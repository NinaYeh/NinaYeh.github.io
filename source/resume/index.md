Experience
----------

### Self-taught Front-end engineer

Combining my experience as a product manager and former web developer, along with designing and developing a system during my graduate studies, I have found that creating a user-friendly service brings a sense of fulfilment. To achieve this, I have taken the initiative to self-learn front-end development technologies. During this period, I honed my skills in Amazon Lightsail, React, HTML, CSS, javascript, and Git for version control, culminating in the creation of a dynamic single-page application called "The Movie App." This project was deployed on GitHub and presented as a GitHub Page project.
